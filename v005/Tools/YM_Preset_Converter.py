#   YM2612 Preset Converter
#

#   This script is intended to convert DefleMask YM2612 and PSG presets to
#   .asm resources for building into the ROM. This is mostly to address the
#   need for a General MIDI instrument set for Chaos Tracker, but in the future
#   it could become a full fledged tool for handling YM2612 and PSG presets.
